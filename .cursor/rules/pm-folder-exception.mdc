# .pm Folder Exception

## ✅ Exception: .pm Folder Operations Allowed

The `.pm` folder (project management) is an **exception** to dot-folder restrictions.

### ✅ What IS Allowed (No Permission Needed)

- Reading, editing, creating, deleting files in `.pm/` folder
- Modifying backlog items, done items, cancelled items
- Creating new project management files
- Any operations on `.pm/**` paths

### 🎯 Purpose

The `.pm` folder contains project management files (backlog, done, cancelled items) and should be treated like any regular project folder - no special permission prompts required.

### 📂 Folder Structure

```
.pm/
├── backlog/       ✅ Can modify freely
├── done/          ✅ Can modify freely
├── cancelled/     ✅ Can modify freely
└── README.md      ✅ Can modify freely
```

### ⚠️ Note

This exception applies **only** to `.pm/` folder. Other dot-prefixed folders (`.git`, `.cursor`, etc.) may still require permission depending on their specific rules.
