# NixFleet - UI/UX Enhancements

**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Backlog

---

## Goal

Minor polish and improvements for the NixFleet dashboard.

---

## Tasks

- [x] **Cache git hash locally on host** — Avoid calling git commands every 10s; cache the hash and only refresh on pull/switch
- [ ] **Device icons** — Add icons for device types (NixOS penguin, Apple logo for macOS, etc.)
- [ ] **Timestamp in locale** — Display timestamps in user's locale format instead of UTC/ISO
- [ ] **Test icon** — Change "check icon" to something more appropriate
- [ ] **Metrics** — Use StaSysMo metrics for the dashboard

---

## Notes

These are polish items to improve the user experience after core functionality is stable.
