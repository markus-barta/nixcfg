# hsb8 Test Suite

This directory contains test procedures and automated scripts to verify that all server features are working correctly.

## Test Format

Each feature has:

- **Test Documentation** (`Txx-feature-name.md`): Detailed manual test procedures
- **Test Script** (`Txx-feature-name.sh`): Automated test script (where applicable)

## Running Tests

### Individual Test

```bash
# Run manual test (follow instructions in markdown file)
cat tests/T01-dns-server.md

# Run automated test
./tests/T01-dns-server.sh
```

### All Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd hosts/hsb8
for test in tests/T*.sh; do
  echo "Running $test..."
  bash "$test" || echo "❌ Failed: $test"
done
```

## Test Status Legend

- ✅ **Pass**: Feature working as expected
- ⏳ **Skip**: Feature not yet implemented or deployed
- ❌ **Fail**: Feature not working, requires attention

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to hsb8 (192.168.1.100 or hsb8.lan)
- Network connectivity
- For ww87 location tests: Server must be deployed at parents' home

**Location Legend:**

- `both`: Can be tested at jhw22 (current) or ww87 (target)
- `ww87`: Requires deployment to parents' home (AdGuard Home features)
- `jhw22`: Only testable at current location

**Status Legend:**

- ✅ **Pass**: Test executed and passed
- ❌ **Fail**: Test executed and failed
- ⏳ **Pending**: Not yet run
- 🔍 **Theoretical**: Analytical check (cannot physically test)
- N/A: Test type not applicable

## Notes

- Tests assume server is at target location (ww87) unless specified
- Some tests require physical access to the server
- DNS/DHCP tests require network isolation for accuracy
