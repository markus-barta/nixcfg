# joe-board-pusher (hsb0)

Read-only paper IB client (`clientId` 92 → `100.64.0.6:4002`) projecting
`inspr.joe.household.v1` and POSTing to `https://cs0.barta.cm/joe/inbox` every
`JOE_PUSH_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 30).

Never connects to live 4001. Never places orders. Uses shared agenix push token.

Stage-0 money excludes grandfathered paper SXR8 lot + leftover TSLA×1 (CONFIG.md) from
since-start / stand / totals; action/learning still name open legacy holdings.

The J desk is calculated as one economic family (J + J2–J5) from recurring,
account-scoped `reqExecutions` and matching actual `commissionReport` callbacks.
The verified period starts at 2026-09-10 00:00 America/New_York; earlier results
remain unavailable. Current explicit broker FX rates convert quote-currency FIFO
PnL and fees to EUR. The durable raw ledger lives at
`/var/lib/joe-board-pusher/family-ledger.json` and is replaced atomically.
Its state binds the account, verified period, family-client classifier, excluded
symbols, last completed capture, and New York coverage day. Because the current
execution request cannot prove a missed net-zero roundtrip across a New York
midnight, the publisher conservatively requires verified backfill at that boundary;
same-day restarts recover through a complete current-day capture.
Within a coverage day, every complete execution query must retain every identity
from the preceding successful query (or provide its higher IB correction revision).
A disappearing identity is treated as an undocumented Gateway cutoff and requires
backfill even when current positions reconcile.

FX uses a separately scoped `reqAccountUpdatesMulti` request. Before the five-minute
freshness window expires, the adapter cancels that request and opens a new request
ID. Only an explicit callback for the current connection and request refreshes a
rate; an unchanged cached value or publisher heartbeat cannot refresh it.

J accounting fails closed while an execution cycle is incomplete, a family fill
lacks its commission, FX is stale, position coverage is incomplete, state is missing
after the authorized bootstrap date, persisted state is corrupt, or execution-query
coverage regresses. In those cases household POSTs continue with J money set to
`null` and J positions omitted; Joe and Joel continue from the valid broker book,
and aggregate money is `null` rather than a misleading partial sum. Disconnects
require fresh executions and FX before J resumes, and any unproved New York day
boundary requires backfill rather than position-only inference.

## Position rows

Per-desk `positions[]` is emitted only after a completed, account-matched IB
`reqPositions` subscription (`position` … `positionEnd`) recognizes the target
managed account and the account/summary downloads also complete. Missing key
means unavailable; `[]` means complete known-empty coverage. Disconnect,
reconnect, or an invalid broker quantity invalidates coverage until a clean
resynchronization.

Legacy symbol mapping remains only for the disabled pre-ledger projection path.
At runtime, J positions come exclusively from the accepted family ledger rather
than projecting every account-level `INTC` row into J. `SXR8`/`TSLA` → `joel`.
Joe has no symbol mapping,
so its desk never receives a `positions` key. Unknown symbols are never mapped to
Joe. Broker observation times come from IB events, not the push heartbeat.
Rows emit `currency` (uppercase contract currency when known) and
`accountingScope` (`legacy` for grandfathered names, `stage0` otherwise).
`mark` is emitted with a known quote currency; `marketValue`/`openPnl` stay absent
until callback currency semantics are verified (EUR alone is not sufficient).
`dayPnl` stays `null` until a real day feed exists. Push heartbeats never advance
the broker snapshot timestamp; before the first complete broker snapshot the
publisher skips the push rather than fabricating an empty book.

Run synthetic replay tests: `npm test` (fixtures are labelled synthetic, not live).
