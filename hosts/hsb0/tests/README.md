# hsb0 Test Suite

This directory contains test procedures and automated scripts to verify that all DNS/DHCP server features are working correctly.

## Test Format

Each feature has:

- **Test Documentation** (`Txx-feature-name.md`): Detailed manual test procedures
- **Test Script** (`Txx-feature-name.sh`): Automated test script (where applicable)

## Running Tests

### Individual Test

```bash
# Run manual test (follow instructions in markdown file)
cat tests/T01-dns-server.md

# Run automated test
./tests/T01-dns-server.sh
```

### All Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd hosts/hsb0
for test in tests/T*.sh; do
  echo "Running $test..."
  bash "$test" || echo "❌ Failed: $test"
done
```

## Test Status Legend

- ✅ **Pass**: Feature working as expected
- ⏳ **Pending**: Feature not yet tested
- ❌ **Fail**: Feature not working, requires attention
- N/A: Test type not applicable for this feature

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to hsb0 (192.168.1.99 or hsb0.lan)
- Network connectivity to hsb0
- For DNS/DHCP tests: hsb0 must be the active network DNS/DHCP server

## Notes

- hsb0 is a production DNS/DHCP server - tests should be run carefully
- DNS/DHCP changes can affect the entire network
- Always have physical access available in case of issues
- Some tests may require temporary network reconfiguration
