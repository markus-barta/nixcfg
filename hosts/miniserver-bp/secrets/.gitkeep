# This directory contains local-only secrets (gitignored)

# Files stored here:
# - wireguard-private.key: WireGuard VPN private key
# - id_rsa:                mba user SSH private key
# - id_rsa.pub:            mba user SSH public key
# - ssh_host_ed25519_key:  SSH host key (preserves server identity)
# - ssh_host_rsa_key:      SSH host key (preserves server identity)
#
# These files are NOT committed to git and must be manually
# copied to the server during NixOS installation:
#
#   scp -r hosts/miniserver-bp/secrets/* root@miniserver-bp:/etc/nixos/secrets/
#
# Why preserve SSH host keys?
# - Prevents "host key changed" warnings after migration
# - Clients already trust these keys from Ubuntu installation
