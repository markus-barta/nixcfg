## Network Configuration

Static IP configured declaratively in NixOS (`configuration.nix`).
NetworkManager is told to ignore `ens3` - NixOS manages it directly.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Subnet is /22, NOT /24!

The Netcup VPS uses a `/22` subnet (85.235.64.0 - 85.235.67.255).
The gateway is at `85.235.64.1`, NOT `85.235.65.1`.

**Incident (2025-12-06)**: Server was locked out due to incorrect subnet (/24) and
gateway (85.235.65.1) configuration. Fixed after DHCP analysis from Gen 22.
See [MIGRATION-PLAN-HOKAGE.md](docs/MIGRATION-PLAN-HOKAGE.md) for incident details.
