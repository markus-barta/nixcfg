## Network Configuration

Static IP configured declaratively in NixOS (`configuration.nix`).
NetworkManager is told to ignore `ens3` - NixOS manages it directly.

**Incident Note**: On 2025-12-05, network was lost during deploy because
NetworkManager had no connection profile. Fixed by adding declarative static IP.
See [MIGRATION-PLAN-HOKAGE.md](docs/MIGRATION-PLAN-HOKAGE.md#-incident-report-2025-12-05-network-loss-during-deployment) for details.
